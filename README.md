# page-saver
This app saves Google Chrome webpages for future use. It is based on a Scrimba tutorial.
To deploy, download (preferably, the zip file) . Go to Google Chrome, click on more tools and then Extensions. Click on Load Unpacked and select the folder. The extension is now ready to be used and can be accessed from the Extensions button(looks like a Jigsaw puzzle piece right beside Chrome's input field).
